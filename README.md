# EduMind_AI
EduMind AI is an interactive education platform that uses AI to generate questions (MCQs). Users choose a subject and preferred language, and the app presents 10 AI-generated questions at a time, each with four options (A, B, C, D). The user selects the correct answer and gets results after each round.
